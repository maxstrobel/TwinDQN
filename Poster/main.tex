    \block{Preprocessing \& Environment}{
    	The environment for the learning agents was OpenAI gym. This toolkit for
    	developing and comparing reinforcement learning agents was used as an interface to Atari 2600
    	games like Breakout or SpaceInvaders, that the agents tried to learn. The interface provides
    	informations about the state of the games as well as the current screen. Due to an internal
    	flickering of the games (e.g. shoots are only on odd frames visible), the current screen is
    	obtained by a maximum operation on two successive frames.
    	Before the screen was feed into the neural network with the screen, it was preprocessed as 	
    	depicted in the graphic below.

    	\end{tikzpicture}
    	In OpenAI gym there exists a frame skipping technique, that was also modified. Instead of
    	skipping randomly between two and five frames, the frame skipping rate was set to a constant
    	value. During the training the rewards were clamped to -1 and 1 to gain comparability between
    	different games. Additional the lost of one live was punished with an reward of -1, whatever
    	the real reward was.
